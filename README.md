Part of an enormous collection of iOS apps, written in _Phonegap_ (aka _Cordova_).

## Background
<details>
  <summary>PhoneGap</summary>

_PhoneGap_ was the framework which became _Cordova_ after it was acquired by _Adobe_.  This is essentially a
web page (_NSWebView_ on _iOS_) running locally.  _PhoneGap_ provides additional functionality to access
hardware on the host platform eg camera, pictures, contacts, but none of these apps needed that.

The main attraction of _PhoneGap_ is that it provides a reasonable way to develop cross-platform apps.
The downside is that not all native functionality is available or accessible.  Further, any UI is
constrained by what is available in a web page.  However, for the types of apps I was developing at the time, 
this was an acceptable compromise.

These were written c2008-c2011 and probably do not show the best practices for Javascript as I was just
learning Javascript and fumbling my way through.  However, in my defence,  "Shipping code trumps everything"!
